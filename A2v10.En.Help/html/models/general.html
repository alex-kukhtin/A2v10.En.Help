	<h3>Datasets</h3>
	<p>
		The first field of each dataset must always be null. 
		The name of this field determines how to interpret this dataset.
	</p>

	<h3>Field naming conventions</h3>
	<p>
		Any name in the system can consist of several (from one to three) items. 
		The name items are distinguished by the symbol <b>!</b> (exclamation point). 
		Note that in SQL-Server, names that contain wildcard characters, spaces, or 
		language keywords must be enclosed in square brackets. 
		
		All parts of the name are optional, but delimiters are always required. 
		In other words, if, for example, a field name begins with <b>!!</b>, then this means that the name is not specified (the field will not be in the model), 
		there is no type, but only a modifier.
		
	</p>

	<ul class="std">
		<li>The first item of the name is always the name of the property (possibly compound) in the model.</li>
		<li>The second item is the type name (for read/write) or the path to a property in the model (for metadata).</li>
		<li>The third item is a modifier that describes either the type of the field or its special purpose.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Recordset types</h3>

	<p>
		The set type is described by the third item (suffix) of the first 
		field of each recordset.
	</p>
