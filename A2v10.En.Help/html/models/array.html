	</div>
	<p>
		An array can be either an independent item of the model (then it has a name and it
		will be displayed in the root of the model), or a child item of some other object.
	</p>
	<p>An array is defined by the <code>Array</code> type (or <code>LazyArray</code> for 
	"lazy" array) in the descriptor (the first field) of the dataset.</p>


	<div class="info tip">
		Note! The arrays with too many items should not be used. In addition to the fact
		that this leads to a drop in performance, it is also very inconvenient for the end
		user to work with. Use server-side sorting, filtering, and paging to work with
		large arrays (tables). <a href="paging">Подробнее...</a>.
		<br />
		<br />
		The recommended size of the array on the client is no more than 100 items. The maximum,
		which does not lead to a noticeable decrease in performance, is about 200 items.
	</div>

	<h3>Regular arrays</h3>
	<p>
		It's simply a recordset. Each row in the set will be a corresponding object of array. The 
		type of the object is determined by the set descriptor.
	</p>

	<h5>Example</h5>
	<p>

		Let there be a fragment of SQL code:

<pre class="code-highlight js" data-lang="sql">
<script type="text/template">
select [Agents!TAgent!Array] = null, [Id!!Id] = Id, [Name!!Name] = Name, Code
from dbo.Agents where ....;
</script>
</pre>

		It will form the <code>Agents</code>. array at the root of the model. Each item of the array will be of 
		<code>TAgent</code> type with the following properties: <code>Id</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>Code</code>.
	</p>


	<h3>Child arrays</h3>
	<p>
		A child array is always nested and is a property of another object. Usually has no name. The parent must have a
		<code>null</code> placeholder property with the item type of the child array. Please note that the child set must
		be processed after the basic one.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to associate an array with a parent object, the recordset must contain a field with a link to the parent
		object in the form <code>[Name!ParentType.PropertyName!ParentId]</code>, where
		<ul class="params">
			<li><b>[Name]</b> - the optional field name. May be empty.</li>
			<li><b>ParentType.PropertyName</b> - the type name and the property name of the parent object where the array item will be recorded.</li>
			<li><b>ParentId</b> - the field modifier.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Binding works as follows:
		<ol>
			<li>The value of the <code>!ParentId</code> field is taken.</li>
			<li>
				The object of the <code>ParentType</code> type with the corresponding identifier is searched for in the
				model (it goes without saying that this identifier should be marked with the <code>!Id</code> modifier).
			</li>
			<li>The field with the <code>PropertyName</code> name is searched for in the found object. The item is added
			to the array corresponding to this field.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<h5>Example</h5>
	<p>

		Let there be a fragment of SQL code:

<pre class="code-highlight js" data-lang="sql">
		<script type="text/template">
		/*basic object*/
		select [Document!TDocument!Object] = null, [Id!!Id] = Id, [Date], [Rows!TRow!Array]=null
		from dbo.Documents where ....;

		/*child array*/
		select [!TRow!Array] = null, [Id!!Id] = Id, [Qty], [Price], [Sum], [!TDocument.Rows!ParentId]=null
		from dbo.DocDetails where ....;
	</script>
</pre>

		It will form the <code>Document</code> object of the <code>TDocument</code> ype at the root with the following properties:
		<code>Id</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>Rows</code>. The <code>Rows</code> property will be the items array of the 
		<code>TRow</code> type with the following properties: <code>Id</code>, <code>Qty</code>, <code>Price</code>, <code>Sum</code>.
	</p>


	<h3>"Lazy" arrays</h3>

	<p>
		Lazy (on demand) arrays are not added to the model in the process, but are loaded the first time the property is accessed.
		Most often, this mechanism is used when the basic model is an array, and the child arrays are not always needed, but only
		on the attempt to display them. A typical example is a list of contractors, each of which contains the documents associated with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lazy arrays can only be children and are defined by the <code>LazyArray</code> modifier.
	</p>
	<div class="tip warning">
		It should be noted that the structure of the child object (not data!) must be known to the system at the initial building of the 
		model. Therefore, when using "lazy" arrays, it is necessary to return an empty recordset, which will define the correct data 
		structure of the array. The array will be filled with real data during the loading process.
	</div>
	<p>
		To load the lazy array, the model load stored procedure will be called with a suffix corresponding to the property name of the
		main model. The ID of the main item will be passed to it as the <code>@Id</code> parameter. It should return a set that corresponds
		to the description of the array in the main model. The property with the <code>!ParentId</code> modifier is optional.
	</p>

	<h5>
		Example
	</h5>
	<p>

		Let there be a list of the contractors with a list of documents.

<pre class="code-highlight js" data-lang="sql">
		<script type="text/template">
		<![CDATA[
		/*basic procedure*/
		create or alter proceduure dbo.[Agent.Index.Load]
		@UserId bigint
		as
		begin
		set nocount on;
		/* basic set */
		select [Agents!TAgent!Array] = null, [Id!!Id] = Id, [Name!!Name] = Name, [Code]
		[Documents!TDocument!LazyArray] = null /* lazy array Documents */
		from dbo.Agents where ....;

		/* TDocument object structure - empty set */
		select [Documents!TDocument!Array] = null, [Id!!Id] = Id, [Date], [Sum], [Memo]
		from dbo.Documents where 0 <> 0;
		end
		go

		/*The procedure for loading a lazy array. The Documents suffix corresponds to the name of the property in the basic model.*/
		create or alter procedure dbo.[Agent.Documents]
		@UserId bigint,
		@Id bigint /*The identifier of the contractor for which the list of documents is loaded*/
		as
		begin
		set nocount on;
		select [Documents!TDocument!Array] = null, [Id!!Id] = Id, [Date], [Sum], [Memo]
		from dbo.Documents where [Agent]=@Id and ....;
		end
		go
		]]>
	</script>
</pre>

		It will form the <code>Document</code> object of the <code>TDocument</code> ype at the root with the following properties:
		<code>Id</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>Rows</code>. The <code>Rows</code> type will be the items array of the
		<code>TRow</code> with the following properties: <code>Id</code>, <code>Qty</code>, <code>Price</code>, <code>Sum</code>.
	</p>


	<p>Lazy array loading procedures can also take parameters and use <a href="paging">pagination</a>.</p>

	<div class="tip info">
		Please note! It is possible to update (reload from the database) only the contents of the lazy array without the basic model.
		To do this, simply pass the array as an argument to the <a class="code-link" href="/xaml/bind/bindcmd">Refresh (Reload)</a>
		command or to the controller's <a class="code-link" href="/client/controller">$reload</a> method.
