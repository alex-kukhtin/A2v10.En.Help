	<p>
		Views can be written in XAML or HTML. The main language is XAML.
	</p>

	<p>
		XAML views are a high-level markup view (similar to WPF and Silverlight
		technologies) and are translated into HTML to work with the current data mode.
	</p>

	<p>
		The two-way binding (Binding) mechanism is used to bind the controls to the data.
		When you change the model data, the view is automatically updated and vice versa.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unlike HTML, the XAML language is "hard", that is, invalid tags and rules 
		cause exceptions. This simplifies the work of the application programmer.
