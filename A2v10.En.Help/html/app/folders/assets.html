			_assets special folder
		</h1>
	</div>

	<p>
		<code>_assets</code> special folder contains common application elements, such as images, JavaScript scripts, or style sheets.
	</p>

	<p>Style sheets (* .css files) and scripts (* .js) from the <code>_assets</code> folder are loaded at the moment of initial program initialization.</p>

	<h3>Script files (*.js)</h3>
	<p>
		Script files are loaded and executed at the moment of initial program initialization. Usually, these files should
		contain modules, although this is optional. By convention, such modules must be prefixed with <code>"app:"</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Regular plug-in modules (without the <code>"app:"</code>refix) will be loaded each time together with the page that refers to them. In contrast,
		modules with the <code>"app:"</code> prefix in the <code>_assets</code> folder are loaded once, when the program is initialized. If the regular
		module is prefixed with <code>"app:"</code>, it will not be loaded.
	</p>

	<p class="tip warning">
		<b>Please note!</b> The folder may contain minified files (* .min.css or * .min.js). If the system finds such files, their usual versions (without 
		the intermediate suffix min) are ignored. This behavior allows you to use standard minimization tools to reduce program loading time.
