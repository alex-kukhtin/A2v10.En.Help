	<p>The <b>A2v10</b> system provides the developer with a high-level object-oriented "designer" of application programs.</p>

	<p>
		In fact, an application program is a simple directory with files. They are model descriptions, views, templates,
		reports, static files, etc. Please note that the application program is "dynamic" in the sense that after changes
		in the program files, the file compilation, project assembly, and deployment are not required.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each endpoint directory represents an endpoint that is addressed via a unique URL address.
	</p>

	<p>
		The endpoint is the point of interaction with the program. Usually, one endpoint is responsible for
		processing one item of the subject field. The endpoint is accessed in a relative way (indicated in the
		URL). The <a href="model" class="code-link">model.json</a>, file must be present in the directory,
		representing the endpoint, which describes possible actions with this endpoint. It can be assumed that
		the sign of the endpoint is the presence of the <code>model.json</code> file in the corresponding directory.
	</p>

	<p>
		The system supports the redirection of the URLs to various endpoints. The
		<a href="redirect" class="code-link">redirect.json</a> redirect file is used
		for this, which must be located in the root directory of the program.

	</p>

	<p>
		The application folder may contain additional <a class="code-link" href="folders/index">special folders</a>.
