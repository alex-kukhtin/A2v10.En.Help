	<p>
		The properties section allows you to add additional properties to the model elements. They can 
		be both scalar (string, number) and <i>computed</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Computed properties are a powerful mechanism that can greatly simplify the implementation of 
		complex business logic in an application. Such a property is a function that is called when 
		an attempt is made to read (or set) a property. The result returned by the function is 
		considered as the value of the property. During the calculations, the function can refer 
		to other computed properties, etc. In this way, it is easy to build dependent data handlers 
		without using the event model.
	</p>

	<p>
		Computed properties can either supplement existing static properties in the model, or replace existing ones.
	</p>

	<p>
		The object describing the properties in the template is a regular JavaScript object. The property names 
		of this object are the fully qualified name of the property (including the name of the object type), 
		and the values are a scalar type, function, or object.

	<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="code-highlight js">
<script type="text/template">
/* properties */
properties: {
	'TypeName.property': String | Number | Boolean, /* scalar property */
	'TypeName.property': Function,                  /* computed property */
	'TypeName.property': {                          /* computed and settable property */
		get: Function,
		set: Function
	}
	...
}
</script>
</pre>
<h3>Naming rules</h3>

<p>
	The <code>TypeName</code> property prefix must match the type <i>name</i>, that is specified when the model is built. By 
	convention, type names begin with an uppercase "T" (for Type).
</p>

<p>
	If a computed property has the same name as a property in the model, then it is not added to the model, but <i>replaces</i>
	the model property. This will cause the computed value to be saved in the model.
</p>

<p>
	If the property name begins with the characters "$" or "_", then it is internal and does not participate in the exchange of
	data between the client and the server. If a property name begins with "$$", then changing it does not change the
	<a class="code-link" href="/client/data">$dirty</a> flag for the model.
</p>

<h3>Scalar Properties</h3>
<p>
	The value of a scalar property is always a primitive JavaScript type such as <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>
	or <code>Boolean</code>. A property of the corresponding type will be added to the model.
</p>


<h3>Computed properties</h3>
<p>
	The value of a computed property is the function that will be computed when an attempt is made to access the property. Function argument:
	<ul class="params">
		<li><code>this</code> - a reference to the object to which the property is added.</li>
	</ul>
	The function should return the value of the property.
</p>
<p>The function is called only when the property is accessed. If there are no calls, the function will never be called.</p>
<p>
	Computed properties can be accessed many times and often. Never use server calls in computed property code. Use caching if necessary.
</p>

<p class="tip warning">
	<b>Please note!</b> Do not use arrow functions when defining computed properties. Arrow functions do not have their own this value (they
	use the parent context), so it will be impossible to get a reference to the object
</p>


<h3>Computed and Settable Properties</h3>
<p>
	In addition to the property read function (getter), you can also specify a set function (setter). 
	This function will be called when an attempt is made to set a property value. Function arguments:
	<ul class="params">
		<li><code>this</code> - a reference to the object to which the property is being added.</li>
		<li><code>value</code> - set value.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Use properties with setters cautiously and carefully. When doing so, it is very easy to get infinite recursion.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
	An example of a document template with computing the amount for the row and the amount for the document. 
	Suppose the model contains a document with rows, each of which has a price and a quantity. It is necessary
	to automatically calculate the amount for the row and the amount for the document.

	<pre class="code-highlight js" data-lang="js">
<script type="text/template">
const template = {
	properties: {
		'TRow.Sum'() {return this.Qty * this.Price }, /*amount for row */,
		'TDocument.Sum': getDocumentSum /*amount for document */
	}
};

function getDocumentSum() {
	return this.Rows.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr.Sum, 0);
}
</script>
</pre>
